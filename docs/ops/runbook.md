# Production Incident Runbook

This runbook provides procedures for handling common production incidents in Lumigift. Each incident includes symptoms, diagnosis steps, resolution steps, and escalation paths.

## General Guidelines

- **Alert Channels**: Incidents are alerted via Vercel monitoring, DataDog, or manual reports
- **Response Times**:
  - P0 (Critical): <15 minutes
  - P1 (High): <1 hour
  - P2 (Medium): <4 hours
- **Communication**: Update stakeholders via Slack #incidents channel
- **Post-Mortem**: Conduct blameless post-mortem for all P0/P1 incidents
- **Secrets posture**: Production secrets must be loaded from a secrets manager, not from `.env` files, to reduce exposure and speed rotation

## Database Connection Failure

### Symptoms
- API endpoints return 500 errors with "database connection failed"
- Application logs show `ConnectionError` or `ECONNREFUSED`
- Dashboard shows stale data
- User login/registration fails

### Diagnosis Steps
1. Check Vercel function logs for connection errors
2. Verify PostgreSQL instance status in cloud provider dashboard
3. Check connection pool exhaustion: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction';`
4. Test database connectivity: `psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -c "SELECT 1"`
5. Check for long-running queries: `SELECT pid, now() - query_start, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state != 'idle' ORDER BY query_start;`

### Resolution Steps
1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**:
   - Step 1: Confirm active connections and idle transactions
   - Step 2: Restart affected Vercel functions or processes
   - Step 3: If the issue repeats, increase pool size and improve query timing
   - Step 4: Monitor until error rate returns to normal

2. **Database Instance Down**:
   - Step 1: Restart the instance in the cloud provider console
   - Step 2: Confirm connectivity with `psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -c "SELECT 1"`
   - Step 3: If restart fails, restore from the latest backup and update DNS if needed
   - Step 4: Reconnect the app, verify writes, and clear stale circuit breakers

3. **Network Issues**:
   - Step 1: Confirm security group or firewall rules for the database
   - Step 2: Validate TLS certificates and connection endpoints
   - Step 3: Test connectivity from a different region or bastion host
   - Step 4: If the network is unstable, switch to an alternative database endpoint if available

### Escalation Path
- If database unrecoverable: Escalate to engineering lead for data restoration
- If widespread outage: Escalate to CTO for customer communication

## Redis Outage

### Symptoms
- Paystack webhook processing fails
- Cron jobs don't execute
- Application logs show Redis connection errors
- User payments stuck in "processing" state

### Diagnosis Steps
1. Check Redis instance status in cloud provider
2. Test connectivity: `redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT ping`
3. Check Redis memory usage: `redis-cli info memory`
4. Verify AOF persistence status: `redis-cli info persistence`
5. Check for long-running Lua scripts: `redis-cli script kill` (if applicable)

### Resolution Steps
1. **Redis Instance Down**:
   - Restart Redis instance
   - If AOF corrupted, follow recovery procedure in `docs/ops/redis.md`
   - Re-queue missed jobs from PostgreSQL backup

2. **Memory Exhaustion**:
   - Increase Redis instance size
   - Clear expired keys: `redis-cli keys "*" | xargs redis-cli del` (careful!)
   - Implement key expiration policies

3. **Connection Issues**:
   - Check Redis ACLs allow application connections
   - Verify TLS configuration if enabled

### Escalation Path
- If data loss: Escalate to engineering lead for job reconstruction
- If Redis cluster issues: Contact cloud provider support

## Stellar Network Degradation

### Symptoms
- Gift claims fail with "network error"
- Contract deployments timeout
- Application logs show Stellar RPC errors
- Users report "transaction failed" messages

### Diagnosis Steps
1. Check Stellar network status: https://status.stellar.org/
2. Test RPC connectivity: `curl -X POST https://soroban-rpc.stellar.org -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth"}'`
3. Check Horizon API: `curl https://horizon.stellar.org/`
4. Monitor Soroban RPC latency and error rates
5. Check application logs for `NetworkError` or `TimeoutError`

### Resolution Steps
1. **Temporary Network Issues**:
   - Step 1: Check Stellar status page and RPC health endpoints
   - Step 2: Pause new contract operations if user impact is high
   - Step 3: Implement exponential backoff and retry failed requests
   - Step 4: Queue failed transactions for later retry once the network recovers

2. **RPC Node Issues**:
   - Step 1: Swap to a healthy alternate RPC endpoint
   - Step 2: Update the app config and restart any long-lived workers
   - Step 3: Validate new RPC connectivity with `getHealth` and `getLatestLedger`

3. **Horizon API Issues**:
   - Step 1: Switch to an alternate Horizon instance
   - Step 2: Enable caching for contract metadata and account lookups
   - Step 3: Monitor for recurring failures and escalate if the provider remains degraded

### Escalation Path
- If network-wide outage: Monitor Stellar status page, no immediate action
- If application-specific: Escalate to engineering team for code fixes

## Paystack Webhook Failures

### Symptoms
- Payments don't update gift status
- Users report successful payment but gift still "pending"
- Paystack dashboard shows webhook delivery failures
- Application logs show webhook signature validation errors

### Diagnosis Steps
1. Check Vercel function logs for webhook endpoint errors
2. Verify webhook URL in Paystack dashboard matches production URL
3. Test webhook signature validation manually
4. Check Redis queue for stuck webhook jobs
5. Verify Paystack API key validity

### Resolution Steps
1. **Webhook URL Mismatch**:
   - Step 1: Confirm the webhook URL configured in Paystack matches the production endpoint
   - Step 2: Update the URL if needed
   - Step 3: Resend failed webhooks from Paystack and verify delivery

2. **Signature Validation Issues**:
   - Step 1: Confirm `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` is set in the production secrets manager
   - Step 2: Verify the app is using the correct secret during signature validation
   - Step 3: Replay webhook deliveries after fixing the configuration

3. **Processing Failures**:
   - Step 1: Inspect the Redis queue and application logs for webhook processing errors
   - Step 2: Clear or replay stuck jobs safely
   - Step 3: Reconcile payment status manually against Paystack if necessary

### Escalation Path
- If Paystack API issues: Contact Paystack support
- If widespread payment failures: Escalate to CTO for payment provider communication

## Log Aggregation

### Overview
All application logs are emitted as structured JSON (pino) to stdout. In production
the log stream is shipped to **Logtail / Betterstack** via the `LOG_AGGREGATION_URL`
and `LOG_AGGREGATION_TOKEN` environment variables.

### Setup
1. Create a **HTTP source** in Betterstack (or your chosen provider).
2. Copy the ingest URL and token into your deployment environment:
   ```
   LOG_AGGREGATION_URL=https://in.logs.betterstack.com
   LOG_AGGREGATION_TOKEN=<source-token>
   ```
3. Set `LOG_LEVEL=info` in production (use `debug` locally).

### Retention Policy
Configure **30-day retention** in the Betterstack source settings
(Sources → your source → Retention).

### Alerts
Configure the following alert rules in Betterstack (or equivalent):

| Alert | Condition | Channel |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| High error rate | `level = "error"` count > 10 in 5 min | Slack #incidents |
| Auth failures | `service = "auth"` + `level = "error"` > 5 in 1 min | Slack #incidents |
| Payment failures | `service = "paystack"` + `level = "error"` > 3 in 5 min | Slack #incidents |

### Key Metrics Dashboard
Create a dashboard with these queries:

- **Request rate**: count of `level = "info"` logs per minute
- **Error rate**: count of `level = "error"` logs per minute
- **Auth errors**: filter `service = "auth"` + `level = "error"`
- **P95 latency**: if using pino-http, filter on `responseTime` field

### Sensitive Data
The logger redacts the following fields before shipping:
`phone`, `recipientPhone`, `recipientPhoneHash`, `authorization`, `cookie`.
